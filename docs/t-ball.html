<p><strong>T-Ball - Age 6 (birth year 2013)</strong></p>
<p>T-Ball is our introduction to baseball and where we start teaching the basics of the game. Time will be spent practicing basic skills; running the bases, hitting, throwing and catching. The other half of the time will involve a game in which the batter hits from a tee and runs the bases.</p>
<p>Two (2) teams will be on the same diamond. As a result, the first part will be spent practicing followed by playing a game each week. Score is not kept as the focus will be on basic baseball skills, team play, sportsmanship and having FUN.</p>
<p>Games are played Saturday mornings starting at 8:30am and diamond location still to be determined.</p>
<p>Players are required to have their own glove and helmet. Running shoes or cleats are to be worn. The League will provide a hat and a team colored jersey.</p>
