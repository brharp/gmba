<p>Select Teams&nbsp;will play approx. 15 games with their select team which is made up of exhibition&nbsp;games and tournaments&nbsp;that are&nbsp;scheduled by&nbsp;each team (coaches and parents) based on player availability as there is no prescribed&nbsp; league play/schedule. Typically teams will enter 2-3 tournaments spread&nbsp;over the months of June, July and August. Teams&nbsp;can apply and&nbsp;participate in the Select&nbsp;Provincial Championship (SOBA's)&nbsp;by a&nbsp;qualification process.</p>
<p>The best way to envision Select is as house league plus and the plus is they get an opportunity to play at a higher level of ball against similar teams from other cities.<br /> <br />The costs&nbsp;incurred by Select&nbsp;Teams for home games, tournaments and uniforms which are divided amongst the players/parents.&nbsp;A Select team typically&nbsp;practice weekly&nbsp;starting mid May to&nbsp;mid August depending on player availability. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
