<p>Rep tryouts are announced in the middle of August, and typically start the first weekend after school starts.
	Teams are picked by the Head Coach at the end of the AAA Tryouts and AA Tryouts. Tryout schedules will be posted
	to the GMBA website.</p>

<p>REP teams are selected in September, and workout over the winter. The first regular season game is the first week
	in May, and the season ends on Labour Day in September, if the team qualifies for Provincials.</p>
<p>GMBA teams play a full ICBA schedule of about 24-28 games. There are 7 Associations that make up ICBA. They are
	Guelph, Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, Brantford, Woodstock and Stratford. Sometimes, team from outside ICBA
	will join a division as an Interlock team. These teams might be from Simcoe, Port Dover, London, Paris, or
	Listowel.</p>
<p>Rep fees depend on the age of the player, number of tournaments the team enters, and how many sponsors the team
	can get. The first payment is usually asked for by the Rep Head Coach at the first team meeting in the fall
	(generally October or November.) Often this payment will cover your registration fee and a small amount for the
	team to start a bank account to make team purchases. There are usually one or two more payments throughout the
	season.</p>
