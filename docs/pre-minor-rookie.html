<p><strong>Pre-Minor Rookie - Age 7 (birth year 2012)</strong></p>
<p>In Pre-Minor Rookie we take the next step and introduce the pitching machine / slinger.</p>
<p>The pitching machine allows players to hit a live ball that is consistent in placement. The ball is thrown at approximately 25 - 30 MPH.</p>
<p>The pitching machine pitches balls in the strike zone to batters. Batters attempt to hit the ball and run the bases to score runs. There are 6 infield positions and remaining players are in outfield positions. Defense and offense will switch after 3 outs or he run limit per inning. No score is kept.</p>
<p>Games are played on Saturday mornings at 11:00am for approximately 2 hours and the season is 12 weeks long.</p>
<p>Players will require their own glove, helmet, protective cup and pants. Baseball cleats are recommended. Metal cleats are not allowed. The league will provide players with a jersey, a hat and ball pants.</p>
