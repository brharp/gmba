## Select League

All questions can be directed to the Select Committee at select@gmba.ca

Select Teams will play approx. 15 games with their select team which is made up of exhibition games and tournaments that are scheduled by each team (coaches and parents) based on player availability as there is no prescribed  league play/schedule. Typically teams will enter 2-3 tournaments spread over the months of June, July and August. Teams can apply and participate in the Select Provincial Championship (SOBA's) by a qualification process.

The best way to envision Select is as house league plus and the plus is they get an opportunity to play at a higher level of ball against similar teams from other cities.

The costs incurred by Select Teams for home games, tournaments and uniforms which are divided amongst the players/parents. A Select team typically practice weekly starting mid May to mid August depending on player availability.   

## Rep League

Rep league is for competitive players from 7 to 16+ years of age. All questions about Rep can be directed to the Rep Committee at rep@gmba.ca.

Rep tryouts are announced in the middle of August, and typically start the first weekend after school starts. Teams are picked by the Head Coach at the end of the AAA Tryouts and AA Tryouts. Tryout schedules will be posted to the GMBA website.

REP teams are selected in September, and workout over the winter.  The first regular season game is the first week in May, and the season ends on Labour Day in September, if the team qualifies for Provincials.

GMBA teams play a full ICBA schedule of about 24-28 games.  There are 7 Associations that make up ICBA.  They are Guelph, Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, Brantford, Woodstock and Stratford. Sometimes, team from outside ICBA will join a division as an Interlock team.  These teams might be from Simcoe, Port Dover, London, Paris, or Listowel.

Rep fees depend on the age of the player, number of tournaments the team enters, and how many sponsors the team can get. The first payment is usually asked for by the Rep Head Coach at the first team meeting in the fall (generally October or November.)  Often this payment will cover your registration fee and a small amount for the team to start a bank account to make team purchases.  There are usually one or two more payments throughout the season.
