	<h1>Rally Cap Ball - Age 4 or 5 (birth year 2014 &amp; 2015)</h1>

	<p>The Rally Cap program was developed using existing baseball initiation programs, as well as adding new ideas in order to enhance players&rsquo; and coaches first experience with the game.</p>
	<p>In the Rally Cap baseball program, each team will consist of 8 to 10 players only. This allows for the formation of more teams, meaning more repetition, which will allow players to improve their individual skills. The program helps teams teach players the five FUNdamentals of baseball in a fun and safe environment. Players have the opportunity to perform different tasks in order to earn a colored Baseball Canada Rally Cap. Cap colours correspond with various levels of achievement. The program is designed for young baseball players.</p>
